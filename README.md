# PointNet meets Self-Attention Graph Pooling A Synergistic Approach to Point Cloud Classification
---
## Abstract
 This research project explores point cloud classification using a combination of PointNet and Self-Attention Graph Pooling architectures. Four variations of architectures were implemented and trained to enhance classification accuracy. The first architecture combines Self-Attention Graph Pooling with node centrality features and xyz coordinates. PointNet is employed as a standalone architecture, capturing local structures using xyz features. Fusion approaches were investigated, including feature concatenation and utilizing PointNet features for subsequent Self-Attention Graph Pooling. Extensive experiments were conducted on the ModelNet10 dataset, showcasing the efficiency of the combined architectures. The fusion approaches demonstrated improved classification accuracy compared to individual architectures, while also reducing model size. The integration of node centrality features further enhanced the discriminative power of the model. This research contributes to the advancement of point cloud classification, highlighting the potential of the combined PointNet and Self-Attention Graph Pooling approach in real-world applications such as object recognition and 3D perception in robotics.
